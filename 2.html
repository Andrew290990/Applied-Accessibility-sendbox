    <!--Задание-->
    Camper Cat has coded a skeleton page for the blog part of his website. He's planning to add a visual break between his two articles with a decorative image of a samurai sword. Add an alt attribute to the img tag and set it to an empty string. (Note that the image src doesn't link to an actual file - don't worry that there are no swords showing in the display.)
